    "text": "Research highlights\n\n\nGrains for Health\n(The Nutrition Project)\nWe believe bread should be food for a healthier life. We have developed special ‘Elite’ seeds that are nearly ready for farmers to plant. These include a ‘gut-friendly’ wheat with reduced immunogenicity, a high-fiber wheat to help prevent disease, and our recently released variety that is naturally packed with extra pro-Vitamin A.\n\n\nLasting Protection\n(The Stripe Rust Project)\nCrop diseases act like ‘hackers’ that are always trying to break into the plant. Our lab is a key watchdog for the U.S., which means we often see new stripe rust races early. Instead of a quick fix that stops working after several years, we study how groups of genes work together to give the plant a durable ‘firewall’ against disease.\n\n\nBetter Plant Design\n(The Low-Input Project)\nWe are rethinking how crops grow so they do not need too much fertilizer and extra water. By using specific genes that change plant architecture, we build crops that stay short and strong while growing deeper roots. This helps farmers get a good harvest even during a drought, and it protects the environment by using fewer inputs.\n\n\nDigging for Secrets\n(The Evo-Mining Project)\nModern farming has focused so much on high yields that it accidentally lost traits that help plants survive heat and stress. We go ‘mining’ in older varieties to find these lost survival secrets. We study the complex DNA of wheat to unlock old ways of staying resilient that have not been seen in modern fields for centuries."

Our research asks a fundamental evolutionary question: how does polyploid genome structure interact with historical selection to shape long-term adaptation? Using wheat as a modern polyploid crop, we compare landraces, modern cultivars, and regionally distinct lineages in multi-environment field trials. This work integrates evolution, polyploid biology, and field performance to identify pathways for rebuilding resilience in modern crops."
