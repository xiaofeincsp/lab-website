We integrate **multi-environment field trials**, **comparative genomics**, and **high-throughput phenomics** to
understand and improve stability in yield, quality, and stress response in small grains.

## Theme 1 — Bio-Design for Human Nutrition

**Engineering Grain for Metabolic Health**

Food security is a function of nutrient density, not just caloric volume.
We treat nutritional quality as a primary breeding objective rather than a secondary trait.
Our research focuses on:

- **Gut Health & Glycemic Index:** Leveraging QTLs and genes for arabinoxylan and high-amylose content to increase dietary fiber.
- **Immunogenicity:** Using gliadin deletions to reduce gluten-related sensitivity while maintaining or enhancing dough processing strength.
- **Micronutrient Density:** Deploying biofortification strategies, such as our recently released high-beta-carotene wheat varieties.

## Theme 2 — Translating Discoveries into Varieties

**Modern Tools, Real-world Impact**

Basic discovery must bridge the gap to deployment. We operate efficient breeding pipelines that integrate:

- **Precision Tools:** Genomic selection, speed breeding, and CRISPR-informed trait introgression.
- **Scalable Phenomics:** High-throughput field phenotyping to capture real-time data on plant development.
- **Impact:** This integrated approach allows us to move efficiently from genetic insight to breeder seed release.

## Theme 3 — Epistasis & Trait Stability

**Stripe Rust as a Model for Complex Gene Interactions**

A persistent challenge in crop improvement is genetic background effects—why a gene works in one variety
but fails in another. We use stripe rust as a biological tool to study this problem in real field environments.
By shifting focus from single R-genes to **gene interaction networks**,
we are developing a framework for durable disease resistance that remains stable across diverse environments.

## Theme 4 — Beyond the Green Revolution

**Optimizing Performance for Low-Input Environments**

The Green Revolution increased yield by relying on high inputs such as fertilizer and irrigation.
However, these systems are increasingly costly and unsustainable.
Our program addresses this limitation by studying **novel semidwarfing genes** that reshape plant architecture
while preserving early vigor, biomass, and grain filling under drought and nitrogen limitation.
This work aims to develop new crop designs that maintain strong yield and stability under real-world farming conditions.

## Theme 5 — Evo-Mining & Polyploid Dynamics

**Unlock the Adaptive Potential of the Wheat Genome**

Modern breeding has increased yields but has narrowed crops' ability to adapt to environmental stress.
Our research asks a fundamental evolutionary question:
how does polyploid genome structure interact with historical selection to shape long-term adaptation?
Using wheat as a modern polyploid crop, we compare landraces, modern cultivars,
and regionally distinct lineages in multi-environment field trials.
This work integrates evolution, polyploid biology, and field performance to identify pathways for rebuilding resilience in modern crops.
