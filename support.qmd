## Why Collaborate with the Foundry
The Small Grain Foundry is built for partnership,
offering a unique 'field-first' infrastructure
that bridges high-level genomics with large-scale phenotypic reality. 

Whether you are a **biotechnologist** looking to validate gene function in elite germplasm,
a **computational biologist** seeking high-quality field data to refine predictive models,
or a **private-sector partner** aiming to deploy resilient, nutrient-dense varieties,
we invite you to join our mission. 
By combining our strengths in **evo-mining**, **stripe rust** diagnostics, and **nutritional bio-design**,
we can accelerate the transition from genetic discovery to real-world agricultural impact.
