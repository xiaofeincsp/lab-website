## What we do

**Redesigning Small Grains for Global Health and Resilience**

Most modern crops are like race cars: they go fast (high yield)
but only with perfect conditions, expensive fuel (fertilizer), and lots of maintenance (water).

**We do things differently.** At the Small Grains Foundry,
we design bread wheat, durum wheat, barley, oat, and triticale that are *tough by nature*.
We develop grains that grow strong in real-world fields with less water and fertilizer,
while producing healthier food for your table every day.

## Research highlights

### Grains for Health

(The Nutrition Project)

We believe **bread** should be food for a healthier life.
We have developed special 'Elite' seeds that are nearly ready for farmers to plant.
These include a 'gut-friendly' wheat with reduced immunogenicity,
a high-fiber wheat to help prevent disease,
and our recently released variety that is naturally packed with extra pro-Vitamin A.

### Lasting Protection

(The Stripe Rust Project)

Crop **diseases** act like 'hackers' that are always trying to break into the plant.
Our lab is a key watchdog for the U.S., which means we often see new stripe rust races early.
Instead of a quick fix that stops working after several years,
we study how groups of genes work together to give the plant a durable 'firewall' against disease.

### Better Plant Design

(The Low-Input Project)

We are rethinking how crops grow so they do not need too much fertilizer and extra water.
By using specific genes that change **plant architecture**, we build crops that stay short and strong while
growing deeper roots. This helps farmers get a good harvest even during a drought,
and it protects the environment by using fewer inputs.

### Digging for Secrets

(The Evo-Mining Project)

Modern farming has focused so much on high yields that it accidentally lost traits that help plants
survive heat and stress. We go 'mining' in older varieties to find these lost survival secrets.
We study the complex DNA of wheat to unlock old ways of staying resilient that have not been seen in
modern fields for centuries.

## Why Join the Foundry?

**We are Field-First.**
We do not just simulate stress on a computer; we solve it where it happens.
You will work in the real-world heat and drought conditions of California,
because that is where true resilience is proven.

**Master the Modern Breeding Toolkit.**
We train students to be leaders in both industry and academia.
You will not just learn one skill; you will master the entire pipeline from lab to harvest:

- **The Tech:** Learn genetic mapping, big data analysis, and high-tech phenotyping (using sensors to measure plant growth).
- **The Science:** Connect molecular and quantitative genetics and evolutionary theory to practical breeding to unlock survival traits in the wheat genome.
- **The Grit:** Gain hands-on experience managing your own field trials—a skill highly valued by top agricultural companies and elite research universities.

**The Goal:** To graduate as a scientist who uses advanced tools to solve real-world problems.
